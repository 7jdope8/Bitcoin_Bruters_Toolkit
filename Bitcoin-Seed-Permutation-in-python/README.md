# Permutation-and-Combination-tool-in-python
Permutation tool in python, generating seed codes for bitcoin keys/addresses

This tool takes your word list and creates any length permutation you desire to produce every possible permutation (not combination, recall permutions order matters, so you get way more permutations that there are combinations)

1) save your word list into a .txt file in the same folder, with one word per line (2 words on the same line will be treated as one)

2) input the MIN and MAX number of permutations you would like to find

3) name the output file.

use the list produce to sha256 and generate private keys.
